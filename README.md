The current version of [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) uses an icon I contributed – really just a refinement of the existing, well-known icon. This repo hosts that version as well as some variations I've made since.

### Figma source

If you'd like to make your own variation, you can take a look at the [Figma source file](https://www.figma.com/file/Ncz44QwwaKXTYejbBie8xe0B/iTerm2-icons?node-id=0%3A16). For creating the `.icns` files, I used [Icon Tool for Developers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/icon-tool-for-developers/id554660130?mt=12).

#### Usage

1. Clone this repository.

  ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:jasonlong/iterm2-icons.git ~/iterm2-icons
  ```

2. Go to `Applications` folder, select iTerm and hit `Cmd+I` (or `right-click -> Get Info`)

3. Open the `~/iterm2-icons` folder.

4. Drag the `.icns` icon of your choice onto the old iTerm2 icon.

_Note that you'll need to repeat this process after updating to a new version of iTerm2._
